		The following form should add a row to the bnpairs table such that the FID entered for Barrier corresponds to the barrier and the FID entered Net corresponds to the net. 
		
		For this version, Temp004, let us not concern ourselves with the possibility that the FIDs entered to this form may be invalid. 
		
		However, there should be validation to at least ensure that two values have been passed.
